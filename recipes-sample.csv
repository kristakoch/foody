Shakshuka,https://cookieandkate.com/foolproof-shakshuka-recipe/,30 min,15,"2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 large red bell pepper or roasted red bell pepper, chopped
¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
3 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, reduce or omit if sensitive to spice
1 large can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes, preferably fire-roasted
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro or flat-leaf parsley, plus addition cilantro or parsley leaves for garnish
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
5 to 6 large eggs
½ cup crumbled feta
Crusty bread or pita, for serving","Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Warm the oil in a large, oven-safe skillet (preferably stainless steel) over medium heat. Once shimmering, add the onion, bell pepper, and salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are tender and turning translucent, about 4 to 6 minutes.
Add the garlic, tomato paste, cumin, paprika and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring constantly, until nice and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
Pour in the crushed tomatoes with their juices and add the cilantro. Stir, and let the mixture come to a simmer. Reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, and cook for 5 minutes to give the flavors time to meld.
Turn off the heat. Taste (careful, it’s hot), and add salt and pepper as necessary. Use the back of a spoon to make a well near the perimeter and crack the egg directly into it. Gently spoon a bit of the tomato mixture over the whites to help contain the egg. Repeat with the remaining 4 to 5 eggs, depending on how many you can fit. Sprinkle a little salt and pepper over the eggs.
Carefully transfer the skillet to the oven (it’s heavy) and bake for 8 to 12 minutes, checking often once you reach 8 minutes. They’re done when the egg whites are an opaque white and the yolks have risen a bit but are still soft. They should still jiggle in the centers when you shimmy the pan. (Keep in mind that they’ll continue cooking after you pull the dish out of the oven.)
Using oven mitts (both hands!), transfer the hot skillet to a heat-safe surface like the stove. Top with the crumbled feta, fresh cilantro leaves, and more red pepper flakes, if desired. Serve in bowls with crusty bread on the side."
Volcano roll ,https://peasandcrayons.com/2013/04/volcano-roll.html,1 hour 45 min,13,"FOR THE ROLLS:
1 cup cooked sushi rice
1-2 tsp seasoned rice vinegar
2 nori seaweed sheets
4-6 green onion stalks plus extra to garnish
1/4 English cucumber, peeled and sliced or about 1/3 of a regular cucumber
2 TBSP cream cheese optional
1 TBSP of toasted sesame seeds optional
VOLCANO TOPPING: CHOOSE 1
8 jumbo shrimp (raw, defrosted, and cleaned/deveined)
4 ounces raw salmon
4 ounces raw bay scallops or sea scallops
SPICY VOLCANO SAUCE:
2/3 cup quality mayo
2 tablespoons Sriracha
whisk together and adjust spice/heat as needed
TOOLS NEEDED:
bamboo sushi mat to roll the sushi
saran/plastic wrap to protect the mat from sticky rice
aluminum foil or parchment paper for the seafood
a spoon or fork to spread the rice","Pre-heat your oven or toaster oven to 350 degrees F.
Cook your sushi rice and allow to stand, covered for 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and add seasoned rice vinegar. Fluff with a fork and allow to cool.
While the rice cooks, I like to start on the spicy volcano topping.
Chop your raw shrimp, scallops, or salmon (or combination of the three!) into small pieces and toss in volcano sauce.
Pour the mixture onto a medium-large square of aluminum foil and roll up the edges a bit to prevent spillage.
Bake for approximatley 15 minutes or until the seafood is opaque and fully cooked. Oven times may vary a tad but it won’t take super long. Since shrimp takes a bit longer to cook, I suggest sauteeing it on the stovetop until it’s almost fully cooked and then finishing it off in the oven with the sauce. Total time-saver!
While your seafood bakes, line a bamboo mat with plastic wrap and top with a sheet of nori.
Slice cucumber into thin strips (I like to remove the seeds from the middle before slicing), roll the cream cheese into two thin strips, and chop the ends off the green onion.
Using a spoon or other utensil, spread rice thinly on the seaweed sheet and then place your cucumber, cream cheese, and green onion in three compact rows at the end of the seaweed square, atop the rice. Since this will make two rolls split your toppings and do the same for each. First time rolling sushi? [click here] for a photo tutorial of the entire process.
Roll, slice, and sprinkle with sesame seeds!
By now your fiery orange volcano topping should be ready. If you’d like, you can add a bit more sauce on top of the seafood and switch the oven to BROIL for 1-2 minutes. I LOVE doing this since it most closely resembles the golden topping my hometown sushi restaurant serves up. This can be done without the extra spoonful of sauce if needed; it’s super flexible. Pour the volcano topping over your cucumber roll and top with an additional stalk or two of chopped green onion."
